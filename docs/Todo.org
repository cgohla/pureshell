* Transformations on the functional input
  The intermediate results should be represented using 'trees that
  grow'. We needs different versions of the functional core language,
  The first stage needs to be isomorphic to
  Language.PureShell.CoreFn.Expr.Expr.

  Steps not necessarily in order here
** TODO Eliminate recursive let blocks
** TODO Turn all lambda abstractions into closed terms

* Usability
** TODO Improve the suite of examples, i.e., output them selectively
** TODO Write integration test

* Procedural IR optimizations
  These might need to operate on the bash grammar
** TODO Eliminate unused variable definitions, in particular unused bindings of positional parameters
** TODO Substitute single use bindings with their values
** TODO Function inlining, also for foreign functions
** TODO Tail call to loop transformation
